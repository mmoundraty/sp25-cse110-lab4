6. Line 13 will result in an error because the variable discountedPrice in line 7 and 13 are not in the same scope as each other
7. Line 14 will print the value 150 because the finalPrice variable is defined outside of the for loop
8. This function returns ```[ 50, 100, 150 ]``` because the values from finalPrice are being pushed into the array discounted
9. Line 11 will result in an error because the variable i in line 6 and 11 are not in the same scope as each other
10. Line 12 will print the value 3 because the length of the prices array is 3
11.  This function returns ```[ 50, 100, 150 ]``` because the values from finalPrice are being pushed into the array discounted
